# Hiring System - AI-Powered Strengths Assessment

An intelligent web application that helps identify and develop people's natural talents through a personalized CliftonStrengths assessment powered by AI.

## Overview

The Hiring System is designed to provide individuals with deep insights into their personality strengths and how they naturally think, feel, and behave. Using a proven assessment methodology combined with artificial intelligence, the system generates an accurate ranking of 34 distinct strength themes that define how someone approaches work and life.

## What is CliftonStrengths?

CliftonStrengths (formerly StrengthsFinder) is a talent assessment system developed by Gallup that identifies your top talents and helps you understand how to leverage them for success. Rather than focusing on weaknesses, it celebrates what you do best and how to build a life around those strengths.

## How It Works

Users complete a three-part interactive assessment:

1. **Initial Assessment** - Quick personality questions to establish baseline preferences
2. **Behavioral Scenarios** - Real-world situations that reveal how you naturally respond
3. **Deep Dive Analysis** - In-depth questions exploring your perceptions and decision-making

The AI analyzes all responses to generate a ranked profile of all 34 CliftonStrengths, from your most dominant talents to areas where you may need to rely on others.

## Key Benefits
